## Notes
* I made this for personal use since i always search my movies and series first and then watch it after checking reviews and scores etc..
* This extension currently only works for movies and series and some anime films which has that right side watch now panel
* Didn't publish this extension to webstore as it was asking for $5 for registation. Don't know if people use this extension lol ;)
* Any suggestion/edit are always welcome :)
